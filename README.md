## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The project aims to develop hands-on experience in deploying Active Directory alongside a Splunk server for real-time monitoring and analysis of active threats, with a focus on identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities. The goal is to acquire insights into quickly identifying and responding to threats.

## TOOLS

- Kali Linux: Linux distribution used for advanced penetration testing and security auditing.
- Splunk server: Platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data via a web-style interface.
- Windows 2019 server: A server operating system by Microsoft that provides various enterprise-level features and services.
- Windows 10: A widely-used operating system by Microsoft designed for personal and professional use on desktops and laptops.
- Crowbar: An open-source tool for automated password cracking and brute force attacks.
- Sysmon: A Windows system service and device driver that logs system activity to provide detailed information for security monitoring.

## SKILLS GAINED

- Proficiency in penetration testing, ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, and the use of various security tools and techniques.
- Expertise in data analysis, log management, creating dashboards and visualizations, and implementing security information and event management (SIEM) solutions.
- Skills in server management, Active Directory, network services configuration, and advanced administrative tasks for enterprise environments.
- Knowledge of desktop management, troubleshooting, system configuration, and integration with other systems and networks.
- Skills in password cracking, brute-force attack techniques, and understanding of authentication mechanisms and their vulnerabilities.
- Ability to configure and analyze detailed system logs, detect suspicious activities, and enhance overall endpoint monitoring and security.
